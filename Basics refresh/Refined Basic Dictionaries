#Dictionaries are callable lists.
#numbers do not need the " " to be called properly
#spacing your prints like here provides a much more professional look that it all residing on the same line.
#I've found it good practice to include notes such as this, and add "f" in all my prints
#.title() and other such things are also good practice
